Examples for the SURE electronics 32x16 bicolor LED dot matrix display.

The very same set of examples is once written in C and once in Python.


Connection
----------

Using a Raspberry PI model B2, you need to connect some GPIO pins to the
LED BR1 port, the input port, like this:

RPI                   SURE
---                   ----
GND             6     GND  8
GPIO 10 (MOSI) 19     DATA 7
GPIO 11 (SCLK) 23     WR   5
GPIO 8  (CE0)  24     CLK  2
GPIO 7  (CE1)  26     CS   1


Build and run C examples
------------------------ 

On your Raspberry PI open a shell, or connect to it by ssh, then inside
this directory execute:

make

Which will build the examples, have a look at the example source code,
the header will tell you what they do, and the steps inside the code
are also documented.

To run the examples you need first to enable the wiringPi spi module like:

gpio load spi


The examples them selfes need to be run with sudo, because you are about
to write to GPIO, hence for example:

sudo ./example1


Python examples
---------------

For instance you need to copy and run the examples from within the project
it's python directory, right there where the modules are placed.

First you need to enable the wiringPi spi module like:

gpio load spi


The examples them selfes need to be run with sudo, because you are about
to write to GPIO, hence for example:

sudo ./example1.py
